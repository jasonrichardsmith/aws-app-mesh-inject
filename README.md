# App Mesh Inject

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aws/aws-app-mesh-inject.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aws/aws-app-mesh-inject)

The AWS App Mesh Kubernetes sidecar injecting Admission Controller.

## Prerequisites
* [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/source/)
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/)

## Install

To deploy the sidecar injector you must export the name of your new mesh
```
$ export MESH_NAME=my_mesh_name
```
Now you can deploy the appmesh injector

### Option 1: clone the repository (You can also run the demo)

```bash
$ make deploy
```

This will bootstrap the required certificates and start the sidecar injector in
your cluster.

To cleanup you can run
```
$ make clean
```

### Option 2: download and execute the install script
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-app-mesh-inject/master/hack/install.sh | bash
```

To cleanup you can run
```
kubectl delete namespace appmesh-inject; kubectl delete mutatingwebhookconfiguration aws-app-mesh-inject; 
kubectl delete clusterrolebindings aws-app-mesh-inject-binding; kubectl delete clusterrole aws-app-mesh-inject-cr;
```

## Running the Demo

You can run the demo app by running
```
$ make k8sdemo
```

The sidecar injector should have injected sidecars into the deployments, so you should see something like this
Pods may be initing which means injection worked
```
$ kubectl get pods -n appmesh-demo
appmesh-demo     blue-866f865cc7-gbb7z             0/2       Init:0/1   0          3s
appmesh-demo     color-green-6b9db9948-lbbbn       0/2       Init:0/1   0          3s
appmesh-demo     color-orange-f78bfd8ff-snf5q      0/2       Init:0/1   0          3s
appmesh-demo     front-end-54f69dfd7b-zjgss        0/2       Init:0/1   0          4s
```
or init completed
```
$ kubectl get pods -n appmesh-demo
NAME                           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
blue-866f865cc7-tkfkv          2/2       Running   0          5s
color-green-6b9db9948-c4qx8    2/2       Running   0          5s
color-orange-f78bfd8ff-chh56   2/2       Running   0          5s
front-end-54f69dfd7b-7qtbh     2/2       Running   0          5s
```

To view the demo webpage run
```
$ kubectl port-forward -n appmesh-demo svc/front-end 8000:80
```
and visit http://localhost:8000/

You should see a lot of red requests

![demo screenshot1](img/screenshot1.png)

The mesh need to be made aware of your pods and how to route them, so you need to run

```
$ make appmeshdemo
```

After a few minutes the demo front-end should switch from all red to around 50% green and 50% blue.

![demo screenshot2](img/screenshot2.png)

This routing is based on demo/appmesh/colors.r.json
```
$ cat demo/appmesh/colors.r.json
{
    "routeName": "colors-route",
    "spec": {
        "httpRoute": {
            "action": {
                "weightedTargets": [
                    {
                        "virtualNode": "orange",
                        "weight": 0
                    },
                    {
                        "virtualNode": "blue",
                        "weight": 5
                    },
                    {
                        "virtualNode": "green",
                        "weight": 5
                    }
                ]
            },
            "match": {
                "prefix": "/"
            }
        }
    },
    "virtualRouterName": "colors"
}
```

You can adjust the weights in this file and then run
```
$ make updatecolors
```

And you should see the traffic distributed evenly across the values you set in the router.

You can clean up the entire demo by running
```
$ make cleandemo
```

## Under the hood
### Enable Sidecar injection

To enable sidecar injection for a namespace, you need to label the namespace with `appmesh.k8s.aws/sidecarInjectorWebhook=enabled`

```
kubectl label namespace appmesh-demo appmesh.k8s.aws/sidecarInjectorWebhook=enabled
```

### Default behavior and how to override

Sidecars will be injected to all new pods in the namespace that has enabled sidecar injector webhook. To disable injecting the sidecar 
to particular pods in that namespace, add `appmesh.k8s.aws/sidecarInjectorWebhook: disabled` annotation to the pod spec. 

All container ports defined in the pod spec will be passed to sidecars as application ports. 
To override, add `appmesh.k8s.aws/ports: "<ports>"` annotation to the pod spec. 

The name of the controller that creates the pod will be used as virtual node name and pass over to the sidecar. For example, if a pod 
is created by a deployment, the virtual node name will be `<deployment name>-<namespace>`. 
To override, add `appmesh.k8s.aws/virtualNode: <virtual node name>` annotation to the pod spec. 

The mesh name provided at install time can be overridden with the `appmesh.k8s.aws/mesh: <mesh name>` annotation.

For example:
```yaml
kind: Deployment
spec:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        appmesh.k8s.aws/mesh: my-mesh
        appmesh.k8s.aws/ports: "8079,8080"
        appmesh.k8s.aws/virtualNode: my-app
        appmesh.k8s.aws/sidecarInjectorWebhook: disabled
```
See more examples in the [demo](demo) section.
